# genesco-comp-percent
Detailed analysis of Genesco data. Through collaboration with Genesco performed analysis of comparative sales increase. Comparative sales increase is considered the "holy grail" of retail so our project partner wants to understand how the their metrics can explain the change in sales for a given week in for one fiscal year compared to the same week for a previous fiscal year. 

Some of the questions that had to be considered while doing the analysis was: Is the company measuring the right things, which metric correlates the most with comp sales increase, and what measures either influence or help explain variations in comp increase. 

The fiscal year runs from February 1 to January 31, and the FY is for the ending year. For example FY2020 began on February 1, 2019 and will end January 31, 2020.
